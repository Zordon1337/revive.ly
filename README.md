# Experiment backend emulator for musical.ly(6.8.0)
it lacks many features, it only has login handler.
There is nothing much to do since i don't have idea how to handle video upload myself
note: after some days of reverse engieering the musical.ly build 6.8.0 i came to conclusion that the musicals were hosted on aws??? but can't confirm because i didin't find any direct url/domain in decompiled files, and still can't figure out the fyp and notifs protcol
